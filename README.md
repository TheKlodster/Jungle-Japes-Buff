# Jungle Japes Indicator Plugin
This plugin plays a sound effect to indicate that banana peels have spawned after
defeating the baboons during the boss fight with Ba-Ba in the Tombs of Amascut.

Players that step on a banana peel during the fight are stunned, and a devastating and
embarrassing (but also relatable) sound effect is played to help be angry for you!

Credit to **stuge** and **rallittelja** for the sound effects, big up Trap House.
