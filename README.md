# Jungle Japes Indicator Plugin

Indicates when the banana peels have spawned and when a player steps on a banana peel
during the Ba-Ba fight in the Tombs of Amascut.

---

This plugin plays a sound effect to indicate that banana peels have spawned after
defeating the baboons during the boss fight with Ba-Ba.

Players that step on a banana peel during the fight are stunned, and a devastating and
embarrassing (but also relatable) sound effect is played to help be angry for you!

Credit to the Runelite team as well as the Runelite Development Discord channel for their
help and guidance on making my first plugin.

Note: if you 1-tick the banana, it never spawns and stuge's sound effect will not play.
