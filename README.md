# Jungle Japes Indicator Plugin

Indicates when the banana peels have spawned and when a player steps on a banana peel
during the Ba-Ba fight in the Tombs of Amascut.

---

This plugin plays a sound effect to indicate that banana peels have spawned after
defeating the baboons during the boss fight with Ba-Ba.

Players that step on a banana peel during the fight are stunned, and a devastating and
embarrassing (but also relatable) sound effect is played to help be angry for you!

## Instructions
1. Download **Jungle Japes Indicator** plugin.
2. Turn it on.
3. Gaming.

Any users that have the plugin installed will be able to hear the sound effects together
in the room.

Credit to **Stuge** and **Rallittelija** for the sound effects, big up Trap House.

Credit to the Runelite team as well as the Runelite Development Discord channel for their
help and guidance on making my first plugin.

Note: if you 1-tick the banana peel, it never spawns and Stuge's sound effect will not play.
